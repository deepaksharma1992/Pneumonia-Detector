# Pneumonia-Detector
This is 4th week assignment of siraj make money with AI course.

https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia This is an classification problem where our Deep Learning model will classify weather the person is suffering from pneumonia or not by predicting from the Xray images.

To run this project, run the Pneumonia Detector.ipynb file in either Jupyter notebook or in Google Colabs notebook using either Pthon 2 or 3 environment.
Enter your kaggle credentials by downloading the credentials file from the kaggle website using Google colaboratory notebook.

This project is an classic example on how to use transfer learning with our own Convolutional neural network. We are extending InceptionV3 model by adding our own layers to predict the X-Ray images containing Pneumonia.

Classification models used in this datasets are-
